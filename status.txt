  User Menu
  - It will have 2 different menus.. one for User Profile
  -2nd for User Admin where user can change 

OTHER IDEAS:
SIGN UP..

So when we start the app, we get an option to login or create a new user account, if we create a user account 
it works exactly the same way as we will do in the admin menu.
