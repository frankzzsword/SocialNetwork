DONE:
Varun:
Header file for all 3 files (PERSON, BST, HASH) is available. Andrew can you upload it before tomorrow?
person.cpp needs a constructor ( DONE )


TO BE DONE:
Varun: put overloaded operators to be used for binary search tree. If we use BST templates, we will need an 
overloaded operator (< and > or == for name ) in person class to compare the objects. I will do that, but will need
to work with Andrew and Boya on this. 

Are you guys available tomorrow before the class or after the class?
